# GitHub Actions Java

A collection of GitHub actions for Java projects.

## Setup Java and Install Dependencies

This action will set up the Java SDK and install all dependencies.

### Example

```yaml
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - uses: aboutbits/github-actions-java/setup-and-install@v1
```

## Versioning

In order to have a versioning in place and working, create lightweight tags that point to the appropriate minor release versions.

Creating a new minor release:

```bash
git tag v1
git push --tags
```

Replacing an already existing minor release:

```bash
git tag -d v1
git push origin :refs/tags/v1
git tag v1
git push --tags
```
